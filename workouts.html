                <h2>Shoulder Workout<i class="fa-solid fa-dumbbell"></i></h2>
                <h3>Overhead Shoulder Press</h3>
                <p>The overhead press (also known as the shoulder press, strict press, or military press) is one of the
                    best shoulder exercises. It can be performed seated using a pair of dumbbells or standing using
                    dumbbells or a barbell. If you experience any muscular imbalances, opt for the dumbbells to iron out
                    weaknesses.

                    As a compound exercise, the shoulder press recruits multiple muscles, including the shoulder
                    muscles, triceps, traps, and lats, as well as the core and glutes, to help with stability when
                    standing. This makes it a great exercise to add to your shoulder workouts for building strength and
                    size in the shoulder muscles, and the whole upper body.</p>

                <h3>Barbell Squat</h3>
                <p>A squat is essentially a movement where you lower yourself down and stand back up. Sounds easy,
                    right? Well, performing the squat correctly actually demands involvement from multiple muscle
                    groups, including those in the legs, core, and back.

                    Squats can be performed using resistance (free weights or machines) to build power and strength or
                    using just body weight to build endurance and cardio both are effective but work to different
                    goals. Squats really can be whatever you make of them and can be used by beginners all the way to
                    professional athletes.

            <h3>Bench Press</h3>
            <h2>Chest Workout<i class="fa-solid fa-dumbbell"></i></h2>
            <p>The bench press is an exercise designed to primarily target the chest muscles. As the bench press is
                a compound exercise, it also involves other muscles such as the triceps and shoulders.

                In essence, the bench press is a simple and safe exercise. The body is supported by a bench, and the
                barbell can be lifted off the correctly placed rack for ease, along with safety bars to reduce risk
                of injury making it easier to try and fail at, than a dumbbell bench press.</p>

                <h3>Pull Ups</h3>
                <h2>Back Workout<i class="fa-solid fa-dumbbell"></i></h2>
                <p>The pull up. Didn’t expect to see this one here? Well, pull ups are actually one of the most
                    effective back exercises for strengthening the lats and teres major.

                    Pull ups are a challenging exercise, but before you skip over this one because you can’t do them,
                    stay with us for a second. There are variations for every level.</p>
